# FreeCodeCamp Project - Build a Wikipedia Viewer

1. Objective: Build a **CodePen.io** app that is functionally similar to this: **[https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/).
2. Fulfill the below **user stories**. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
3. User Story: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
4. User Story: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.
5. Hint #1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random`.
6. Hint #2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: `https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page`.
7. Hint #3: Use this **[link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=jsonfm)** to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
8. Remember to use **Read-Search-Ask** if you get stuck.
9. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
10. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
